This repository keep the main files of my graduation project. I am developing a synthesizable Genetic Algorithm written in SystemVerilog.

The repo contain the folders `src/` and `sim_src/`. The `src/` folder hold all the modules designed for the Genetic Algorithm and the `sim_src/` folder hold the simulation testbench files, used to test each module.

> I am still developing the project so the files might need some organization and maybe there are some extra files wich will be deleted later.
